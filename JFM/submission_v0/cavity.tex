\section{Open Cavity Flow}
\label{sec:cavity_setup}

The setup of the two-dimensional open cavity flow follows exactly as has been described in \cite{negi24}, which follows from that of \cite{sipp07}. Briefly, the domain consists of a square cavity with sides of length one and an open channel flow is constructed above the cavity. 

The open channel has a width of $0.5$ above the cavity and a symmetry boundary condition is applied to the upper boundary of the channel. A uniform (streamwise) velocity boundary condition of $u=1$ is applied to the inlet located at $x=-1.2$. A symmetry boundary condition is applied to the lower wall of the channel from the inlet to $x = -0.4$ which allows the flow to develop freely from the inlet. A no-slip condition is applied on the lower wall thereafter uptill  $x = 1.75$ (including the cavity walls), after which, a symmetry condition is applied again from $x = 1.75$ to the outlet, located at $x = 2.50$. The continuous system is descretized using the spectral-element-method \citep{patera84} and the Nek5000 code \citep{nek5000} is utilized for the computations. 

The critical point for the particular geometry is found to be $Re_{c}=4131.33$. There is a slight variability in the literature on the value of the bifurcation point \citep{sipp07,meliga17,bengana19}. However all reported are within $1\%$ error of each other, and the calculated value here falls within that range. The base flow at bifurcation is shown in figure~\ref{fig:cavity_base_spectrum} (left). The calculated baseflow velocities will be denoted $\vecUb = [\vecUb_{x}; \vecUb_{y}]$ (which includes its two components) and, its associated pressure field is given by, $\vecPb$. Hereafter we will only deal with the deviation from this base flow velocities $\vecu = [\vecu_{x};\vecu_{y}]$ and pressure $\pfield{p}$, with the total velocity field being $\vecU = \vecUb + \vecu$, and the total pressure given by $\pfield{P} = \vecPb + \pfield{p}$. The governing equations for the velocity and pressure deviations are given by the Navier--Stokes. Considering the velocity and pressure together as one vector $\vecubar = [\vecu; \pfield{p}]$, we write this compactly as,
%\begin{subequations}
%	\label{eqn:deviation}
%	\begin{align}
%		\dfrac{\partial \vecu}{\partial t} =& -\vecu\bcdot\nabla\vecUb - \vecUb\bcdot\nabla\vecu - \vecu\bcdot\nabla\vecu - \nabla\pfield{p} + \inv{\Rey}\nabla^{2}\vecu, \\
%		\nabla\bcdot\vecu =& 0.
%	\end{align}
%\end{subequations}
%Considering the velocity and pressure together as one vector $\vecubar = [\vecu; \pfield{p}]$, we write this compactly as,
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn:compact_evolution1}
	\partial \vecubar/\partial t = \Lu\vecubar + \Nu(\vecubar), & \\
	% 
	\Lu = \begin{bmatrix}
		\inv{\Rey}\nabla^{2} - (\vecUb\bcdot\nabla) -(\nabla\vecUb)\bcdot &  -\nabla \\
		\nabla\bcdot&  0
	\end{bmatrix}, &&
	%
	\Nu(\vecubar) = \begin{bmatrix}
	- \vecu\bcdot\nabla\vecu \\
	0
	\end{bmatrix}, \nonumber
\end{align}
where, $\Lu$ and $\Nu$ are respectively the linear and non-linear operators at bifurcation. The calculated spectrum at bifurcation is shown in figure~\ref{fig:cavity_base_spectrum} (right), which was calculated using the Krylov-Schur algorithm \citep{stewart02}. The spectral problem was also solved for the adjoint operator.

\end{figure}

A single pair of complex-conjugate neutral modes can be observed in the figure~\ref{fig:cavity_base_spectrum}, lying on the $x-$axis line. This pair of modes (numbered $1$ and $2$), with the eigenvalue $\lambda_{1,2} = \pm7.495\iota$, governs the dynamics of the first limit cycle that emerges as the system moves just past the bifurcation point \citep{negi24,bengana19}. However, deep in the stable spectrum lies another pair of modes with the eigenvalues $\lambda_{3,4}=-0.092\pm10.31\iota$, marked by the gray circles. This mode has been found to be responsible for the second limit cycle oscillation that becomes dominant with further increases in Reynolds numbers \citep{bengana19}. One can not directly incorporate this mode into the center manifold evaluation of the system given by equation~\ref{eqn:compact_evolution1}. However, if one could perturb the system so that modes $3$ and $4$ are also neutral simultaneously with modes $1$ and $2$, then one has a co-dimension 2 bifurcation point and the resulting center manifold would be the nonlinear continuation of both these pair of modes. Such a system is easily built. Denoting the direct and adjoint eigenvectors for the modes as $\vecvbar_{i}$ and $\vecwbar_{i}$, respectively, with $i\in1,2,3,4$, one may build a synthetic system as,
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn:compact_evolution2}
	\partial \vecubar/\partial t = \widetilde{\Lu}\vecubar + \Nu(\vecubar), && \widetilde{\Lu} = \Lu + \sigma(\vecvbar_{3}\vecwbar^{\dagger}_{3} + \vecvbar_{4}\vecwbar^{\dagger}_{4})
\end{align}
where $^{\dagger}$ represents the complex-conjugated transpose and $\sigma$ is the new pseudo-parameter that has been introduced. The eigenvectors of the new linearized system $\widetilde{\Lu}$ are identical to those of $\Lu$. All eigenvalues except for $\lambda_{3,4}$ are also identical. The new affected eigenvalues are $\widetilde{\lambda}_{3,4} = \lambda_{3,4} + \sigma$. Clearly, if one sets $\sigma = -\mathfrak{R}(\lambda_{3,4})$, \ie the real part of $\lambda_{3,4}$, then the eigenvalues of these modes gets mapped to the $x-$axis, as indicated by the arrows in figure~\ref{fig:cavity_base_spectrum}. Therefore we now have a system with a co-dimension two bifurcation.



\section{A Reduced Representation}
\label{sec:center_manifold}

One may evaluate not just the standard center manifold emanating from the fixed point of the new system, but also a parameter dependent (usually asymptotic) center manifold so that variations of Reynolds number can be obtained on a reduced representation of the system. Typically, one takes the inverse Reynolds number variation as a small parameter, $\inv{\Rey} = \invRec(1 - \epsilon)$, or some variation thereof, accounting for scaling \citep{sipp07,carini15,negi24}. In this case we would also like to consider the variation with respect to the newly introduced parameter $\sigma$. We would therefore consider a perturbation of this parameter as $\sigma = \sigma_{0} + \sigma'$, where $\sigma_{0} = -\mathfrak{R}(\lambda_{3,4})$.

Parametric (and asymptotic) center manifold evaluation can be performed in multiple different ways depending on one's preference and style. One could consider power series expansions in the amplitudes of the center subspace modes and then augment the power series with additional polynomial terms to account for the additional parameter perturbations, here $\epsilon$  and $\sigma'$, as has been done in \cite{coullet83,roberts14,carini15}. Alternately, one could consider extended systems, and include additional trivial equations for the parameter evolutions, thereby promoting parameter perturbations to intrinsic center subspace modes of the extended system, an often used trick for small dynamical systems, with some applications to larger systems as well \citep{mercer90,cox91,negi24,vizzaccaro24}. Recently, asymptotic expansions of spectral submanifolds of extended systems was performed in \cite{vizzaccaro24} in the context of external forcing. The consequences of system extension have been investigated to significant depth in the context of center manifolds in \cite{negi26}. The extended systems approach was taken here. The methodology is described here only conceptually. One may find detailed exposition of asymptotic evaluation of invariant manifolds in several works in the literature, see for example,  \cite{coullet83,wiggins03,roberts14,carini15,jain22,vizzaccaro24,negi24,negi26}.  

Briefly, the solution of equation~\eqref{eqn:compact_evolution2} restricted to the center manifold is assumed to be, $\vecubar(t) = \vecybar(\vecparv(t))$, where, $\vecparv$ is the vector of dimensionality equal to the dimensionality of the center subspace (of the extended system). The time evolution of $\vecparv$ is assumed to be, $\dt{\vecparv} = \mathcal{G}(\vecparv)$, where, $\mathcal{G}$ is the sought after reduced representation of the system dynamics. Both $\vecybar$ and $\mathcal{G}$ are expanded as a power series in $\vecparv$, and their substitution into equation~\eqref{eqn:compact_evolution2} results in a series of homological equations, that can be solved order by order. To obtain the reduced representation in its normal form, all entries in the asymptotic expansion of $\mathcal{G}$ are set to zero, except those that are required to remove singularities due to resonance terms in the homological equation. 

The normal form of the parametric center manifold obtained for the synthetic system is given below,
\begin{subequations}
	\label{eqn:normal_form}
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eqn:normal_form1}
		\begin{aligned}
				\dt{\parv_{1}} =& +(7.495\iota)\parv_{1} 
				%
				+ (0.835 + 0.724\iota)\parv_{1}\epsilon \\
				%
				& + (0.325 + 0.230\iota)\parv_{1}(\epsilon)^{2}
				%
				   - (0.004 - 0.001\iota)\parv_{1}\epsilon\sigma'  \\
				%
				& - (1553.8 + 342.5\iota)\parv_{1}|\parv_{3}|^{2}
				%
				  - (573.2 - 340.0\iota)\parv_{1}|\parv_{1}|^{2},
			\end{aligned} 
	\end{equation}
	%
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eqn:normal_form3}
		\begin{aligned}
			\dt{\parv_{3}} =& +(1.0\sigma' + 10.31\iota)\parv_{3} 
			%
			+ (1.801 + 1.096\iota)\parv_{3}\epsilon \\
			%
			& + (0.631 + 0.395\iota)\parv_{3}(\epsilon)^{2}
			%
			- (0.005 - 0.001\iota)\parv_{3}\epsilon\sigma'  \\
			%
			& - (751.0 + 6.987\iota)\parv_{3}|\parv_{3}|^{2}
			%
			- (829.4 - 275.2\iota)\parv_{3}|\parv_{1}|^{2}.
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
Here, $\parv_{1}$ refers to the amplitude corresponding to the $\widetilde{\lambda}_{1}$ mode and $\parv_{3}$ refers to the amplitude of the $\widetilde{\lambda}_{3}$ mode. The equations for $\parv_{2}$ and $\parv_{4}$ are the corresponding complex conjugates of equation~\ref{eqn:normal_form}. As mentioned earlier, $\epsilon$ is the perturbation parameter for the Reynolds number, defined using $\inv{\Rey} = \invRec(1 - \epsilon)$. This is the normal form of the synthetic system defined in equation~\eqref{eqn:compact_evolution2}. However, if we consider $\sigma' = - \sigma_{0}$, the additional terms that were introduced to generate the synthetic system and one obtains the original system that had a co-dimension one bifurcation point. The first term on the right hand side in equation~\eqref{eqn:normal_form3} becomes $(-0.092 + 10.31\iota)\parv_{3}$, which is precisely the $\lambda_{3}$ eigenvalue of the original system. Henceforth the value of $\sigma'$ is held fixed and it is treated simply as another constant coefficient term. 

The reduced system can be integrated in time to obtain the system response for different Reynolds numbers. This is plotted in figure~\ref{fig:response} for $\Rey=4200$, where one could expect the limit cycle associated with $\lambda_{1,2}$ to emerge, and for $\Rey=4500$, where $\lambda_{3,4}$ modes limit-cycles could possibly emerge. The mode amplitudes $\parv_{1},\parv_{3}$ were given a small random initialization and the evolution is tracked. For $\Rey=4200$, the mode amplitude $\parv_{3}$ has decayed to zero and $\parv_{1}$ dominates the system response. On the other hand, for $\Rey=4500$, the situation is reversed and $\parv_{3}$ dominates the system response and $\parv_{1}$ has decayed to zero. The final system frequencies are then determined by the dominating modes at saturation. The peak value of the mode oscillations is plotted for the entire time history in the right most panel in figure~\ref{fig:response}. The opposing evolution of the two modes at the two different Reynolds numbers is clearly visible.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{response_Re4200}

	\includegraphics[width=0.32\textwidth]{peak_response}
	\caption{Real part of the time varying response of the reduced system at (left) $\Rey=4200$ and (center) $\Rey=4500$. The labels $\parv_{1}$ (blue), and $\parv_{3}$ (orange) correspond to the amplitudes of the modes $\lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{3}$ respectively. The figure on the right shows the time evolution of peak of the oscillation amplitudes for the two modes $\parv_{1},\parv_{3}$, and for the two different Reynolds numbers, $Re=4200$ (solid lines) and $Re=4500$ (dashed lines).}
	\label{fig:response}
\end{figure}

To further determine the points where the mode switching takes place, one can obtain the evolution equations for the square amplitudes, $|\parv_{1}|^{2}$ and $|\parv_{3}|^{2}$ from equation~\eqref{eqn:normal_form}, by multiplying each equation by its conjugate variable, \ie, we multiply equation~\eqref{eqn:normal_form1} by $\parv^{*}_{1}$ and equation~\eqref{eqn:normal_form3} by $\parv^{*}_{3}$. Utilizing the conjugate equations allows us to get rid of the imaginary terms and one obtains the equations for the squared amplitudes as,
\begin{subequations}
	\label{eqn:amplitude_equations}
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eqn:amplitude1}
		\begin{aligned}
			\dfrac{d |\parv_{1}|^{2}}{dt} =& (1.669\epsilon + 0.649\epsilon^{2} - 0.007\epsilon\sigma' - 3107.6|\parv_{3}|^{2} - 1146.4|\parv_{1}|^{2})|\parv_{1}|^{2},
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
	%
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eqn:amplitude3}
		\begin{aligned}
			\dfrac{d |\parv_{3}|^{2}}{dt} =& (3.603\epsilon + 2.0\sigma' + 1.262\epsilon^{2} - 0.011\epsilon\sigma' - 1502|\parv_{3}|^{2} - 1658.8|\parv_{1}|^{2})|\parv_{3}|^{2}.
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
These equations can be analyzed for equilibrium when the time derivatives vanish. Since both $\epsilon$ and $\sigma'$ are just treated as constant parameters, equation~\eqref{eqn:amplitude_equations} can be analyzed by parametrically plotting the null-clines of the evolution functions on the right hand sides of the two equations, while restricting the analysis to the first-quadrant of the $|\parv_{1}|-|\parv_{3}|$ phase plane. Obviously, $|\parv_{1}| = 0$ and $|\parv_{3}| = 0$ are the trivial null-clines for equations~\eqref{eqn:amplitude1} and \eqref{eqn:amplitude3} respectively. These represent the complete absence of the respective modes at equilibrium. The non-trivial null-clines, representing limit-cycle oscillation amplitudes are given by,
\begin{subequations}
	\label{eqn:nullclines}
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eqn:nullcline1}
		\begin{aligned}
			 3107.6|\parv_{3}|^{2} + 1146.4|\parv_{1}|^{2}=& 1.669\epsilon + 0.649\epsilon^{2} - 0.007\epsilon\sigma',
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
	%
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eqn:nullcline3}
		\begin{aligned}
			1502|\parv_{3}|^{2} + 1658.8|\parv_{1}|^{2} =& 3.603\epsilon + 2.0\sigma' + 1.262\epsilon^{2} - 0.011\epsilon\sigma',
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
that represent a pair of ellipses for the variables $|\parv_{1}|$ and $|\parv_{3}|$. These non-trivial null-clines with be referred to as the LCO null-clines. At $\epsilon=0$, representing the bifurcation point, the right hand side (\rhs) for equation~\eqref{eqn:nullcline3} is $2\sigma'$, which is negative, and there are no solutions for this equation. Therefore at bifurcation, no limit-cycle for the $\lambda_{3,4}$ mode exists. The \rhs for equation~\eqref{eqn:nullcline1} is zero, and a trivial solution $\parv_{1}=0$, $\parv_{3}=0$ exists. This of course represents the birth of the first limit-cycle associated with the $\lambda_{1,2}$ mode, as one would expect. \cite{bengana19} refer to this as $\Rey_{2}$. The authors have numbered the important bifurcation events based on the closest limit cycle that can be associated with the event. Here, we follow the numbering sequentially in order of its occurrence as $\epsilon$ is increased. To avoid confusion, we will refer to the bifurcation events in this study with an overhead tilde, so the first bifurcation point will be refered to as $\widetilde{\Rey}_{1}$. As $\epsilon$ is increased the \rhs of equation~\eqref{eqn:nullcline1} becomes non-zero and a non-trivial solution of $|\parv_{1}|$ can be found, with $|\parv_{3}|=0$ (trivial nullcline), which represents the growing $\lambda_{1,2}$ mode limit-cycle as the system moves away from the bifurcation point.

The next interesting point occurs when $\lambda_{3,4}$ mode limit cycle is born. This occurs when the \rhs for equation~\eqref{eqn:nullcline3} is first non-negative, and $|\parv_{1}|=0$, which occurs for, 
\begin{align}
	\label{eqn:second_bifurcation}
	3.603\epsilon_{2} + 2.0\sigma' + 1.262\epsilon^{2}_{2} - 0.011\epsilon_{2}\sigma' = 0; & \implies \epsilon_{2} = 0.05; & \widetilde{\Rey}_{2} = 4349.6.
\end{align}
\cite{bengana19} refer to this as $\Rey_{3}$ and obtain a value of $4348$ through a quadratic approximation, which is remarkably close to the value obtained here. The null-clines for the system are shown in the first panel from the left in figure~\ref{fig:bifurcations}. The fixed points are marked using circles, with stable fixed points denoted by filled circles, while unstable ones denoted by empty circles. Further increases in Reynolds number result in two distinct LCO null-clines however, these LCO null-clines intersect only with the trivial null-clines, $|\parv_{1}|=0$ or $|\parv_{3}|=0$. Therefore no invariant quasi-steady solutions exist so far. The bifurcation to a quasi-steady solution occurs at $\widetilde{\Rey}_{3}=4415.7$, when the two LCO null-clines intersect. This corresponds to $\Rey'_{3}=4410$ in \cite{bengana19}, which is again close to the value obtained here. In \cite{bengana19} the authors find that around this bifurcation the characteristics of the quasi-periodic state are much closer to those of the limit-cycle of the second bifurcation, which they refer to as $LC_{3}$ ($\lambda_{3,4}$-mode LCO in the current study). This is indeed what is found here as well. The first intersection of the two LCO null-clines occurs for a vanishing value of $\parv_{1}$. Therefore, at the inception of the quasi-steady state the $\lambda_{1,2}$ limit cycle has a vanishingly small amplitude and the quasi-periodic state characteristics will be dominated by those of the $\lambda_{3,4}$ limit cycle.

The quasi-steady solutions have been identified as the edge state between the two limit cycles in \cite{bengana19}. As the Reynolds number is further increased, the edge-state has non-trivial components of both the $\parv_{1}$ and $\parv_{3}$ mode amplitudes. The edge-state moves along the intersection of the null-clines untill at $\widetilde{\Rey}_{4}=4853.8$ the edge state is such that it has a vanishing $\parv_{3}$ component. The quasi-periodic state ceases to exist beyond this point. In \cite{bengana19} the disappearance of the of the edge state is found to be at around $\Rey'_{2}=4600$, which is a bit different from what is predicted in the current study. We comment on this point later in the section. Beyond $\widetilde{\Rey}_{4}$, there exist two distinct fixed points of the system, one for each limit cycle.

\end{figure}

The role of the cubic terms in equation~\eqref{eqn:normal_form}, or the quartic terms in equation~\eqref{eqn:amplitude_equations} is to provide a saturation mechanism for a growing limit-cycle (when the coefficient of these terms is negative). For a standard Hopf bifurcation, only a self saturation term exists, $|\parv_{1}|^{4}$ for equation~\eqref{eqn:amplitude1} for example, and the cross interaction term $|\parv_{1}|^{2}|\parv_{3}|^{2}$ is absent. The cross-interaction terms in both equations~\eqref{eqn:amplitude1} and ~\eqref{eqn:amplitude3} have a negative sign so that the presence of one mode strengthens the saturation mechanism of the other. 

Earlier, we identified the second bifurcation in the flow as the first non-trivial existence of the $\lambda_{3,4}$ LCO, which is the top left panel in figure~\ref{fig:bifurcations}. However, this bifurcation occurs when $|\parv_{1}|=0$. If we imagine a commonly employed strategy for analyzing systems, which is to slowly vary a system parameter and observe the response, the bifurcation scenario looks different. Increasing the Reynolds number marginaly from the first bifurcation point and allowing the system to equilibriate, means that the system reaches the fixed point lying of the $|\parv_{1}|$ axis in figure~\ref{fig:bifurcations}. The system then follows the fixed point with slow increases of the Reynolds number. At the second bifurcation point, $\widetilde{\Rey}_{2}$, the $\lambda_{3,4}$ LCO would emerge (at least transiently) for a queiscent flow state, however, the non zero $|\parv_{1}|$ leads to added damping effects and the LCO remains stable. In this scenario, the $\lambda_{3,4}$ LCO can only emerge when the \emph{effective} eigenvalue for the $\parv_{3}$ evolution starts having a non-negative real part. This cross-over point can be found by looking at the Reynolds number dependent multiplier of $|\parv_{3}|^{2}$ in equation~\eqref{eqn:amplitude3}, given by, 
\begin{align}
	d|\parv_{3}|^2/dt =& \alpha_{3}(\epsilon)|\parv_{3}|^{2} \nonumber \\
	\alpha_{3}(\epsilon) =& 3.603\epsilon + 2.0\sigma' + 1.262\epsilon^{2} - 0.011\epsilon\sigma' - 1658.8|\parv_{1}(\epsilon)|^{2}, \nonumber
\end{align}
where, $|\parv_{1}(\epsilon)|$, is the Reynolds number dependent equilibrium value of $|\parv_{1}|$ for $|\parv_{3}|=0$. When $\alpha_{3}(\epsilon)$ first becomes non-negative, is the new ``path dependent'' bifurcation point. This is found to coincide with $\widetilde{\Rey}_{4}=4853.8$. At this point, the $\lambda_{1,2}$ LCO becomes unstable, since, any increase in $\parv_{3}$ strengthens the saturation mechanism provided by the cross interaction terms for $\lambda_{1,2}$ LCO, and therefore reduces the equilibrium value of $|\parv_{1}|$. This reduction in $|\parv_{1}|$ implies the effective growth rate for $\parv_{3}$ becomes larger, and a feedback loop is established, moving the system away from the fixed point on the $|\parv_{1}|$ axis, ending up at fixed point on the $|\parv_{3}|$ axis, and the system now exhibits the $\lambda_{3,4}$ LCO. The system now follows this new fixed point with further slow increases in Reynolds numbers. 

The phenomenon repeats itself with the roles of the two limit cycles switched when the system is slowly varied in the opposite direction. For a high enough Reynolds number the $\lambda_{3,4}$ LCO exists and the system is at the equilibrium point on $|\parv_{3}|$ axis. Again, the non-zero $|\parv_{3}|$ causes $\parv_{1}$ to have a damped effective eigenvalue, thereby suppressing the emergence of the $\lambda_{1,2}$ LCO. The effective growth rate along the decreasing Reynolds number path is again predicted using the terms linear in $|\parv_{1}|^{2}$ in equation~\eqref{eqn:amplitude1}, 
\begin{align}
	\alpha_{1}(\epsilon) =& 1.669\epsilon + 0.649\epsilon^{2} - 0.007\epsilon\sigma' - 3107.6|\parv_{3}(\epsilon)|^{2}, \nonumber
\end{align}
where $|\parv_{3}(\epsilon)|$ is the Reynolds number dependent equilibrium value of $|\parv_{3}|$. As one might anticipate, $\alpha_{1}(\epsilon)$ becomes non-negative at $\widetilde{\Rey}_{3}$ and the same feedback loop described earlier, now causes the system to move away from the $\lambda_{3,4}$ LCO and reach the $\lambda_{1,2}$ LCO equilibrium point. The $\lambda_{1,2}$ LCO remains stable below $\widetilde{\Rey}_{3}$ untill the first bifurcation point is reached. Between $\widetilde{\Rey}_{3}$ and $\widetilde{\Rey}_{4}$ the system would exhibit bistability.

Finally, since the amplitudes at the equilibrium points are known through the reduced equations, the equilibrium frequencies can also be predicted. This is shown in figure~\ref{fig:equilibrium_omega}. The blue line indicates the angular frequencies for the $\lambda_{1,2}$ LCO equilibrium point, while the orange line indicates the angular frequencies for the $\lambda_{3,4}$ LCO. The dashed lines indicate the angular frequencies for the respective modes at the quasi-periodic edge state. The filled black circles indicate the results obtained through the non-linear simulations. The $\lambda_{1,2}$ LCO angular frequencies are well predicted while a small deviation exists for the $\lambda_{3,4}$ LCO at higher Reynolds numbers. This would be typical of an asymptotic reduction where, the errors increase as the system is moved further away from the (first) bifurcation point.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

A reduced mathematical model for the flow in an open cavity is presented. The model is derived through a center manifold manifold reduction of a perturbed system resulting in a co-dimension two bifurcation point. The original system is then approximated asymptotically, along with the Reynolds number and center subspace mode variations, resulting in a normal form of a Reynolds number dependent double Hopf bifurcation. The model exhibits many of the key characteristics of the system found in the detailed study by \cite{bengana19}, including existence of bistability, switching of the stability of the limit cycles and a quasi-periodic edge state between the two limit cycles. The reduced model provides a mechanism for the switching of the stability of the two limit-cycle oscillations based on the cross-interaction term and effective eigenvalue of the modes at the equilibrium points of the limit-cycles, and also predicts the Reynolds number values where the switching of stability occurs.
